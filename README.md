# Auto-Registration
Collection of scripts used to automatically register for classes. 
Enclosed is 3 programs. 

## Automated scheduler Instructions
* Icognito mode in order to stop chrome from trying to save your new pin. (It fucked me up last time)
* Go to you add drop classes and make sure you select the correct term. 
* Click your cursor in the pin box and leave it there.
* Make sure to leave your laptop on all night. You can dim it completely so you don't see the screen
	** or just put it somewhere else so you don't have to see the lights
* The program will automatically execute at 7AM so you don't have do anything besides make sure it works. If it doesn't work read below


## Manual ClassMaker 
* If the automated program doesn't work press CTRL + 8  thats only two buttons CTRL and the button 8
* The automated scheduler handles the pin being input so you should be good. But if it doesn't have the pin on your copy paste.
* The manual classmaker is only for after the pin, the CRNs. 
* This will automatically input all the CRNs but not your PIN. It will enter all the CRNs and then finalize the registering

Notes::::  The automated scheduler takes about 5 seconds to run. So the automated one can get messed up if the internet is slow loading the page.
That is why I have included the manual. But the automated works if everything goes according to plan.



## Timer	

**IMPORTANT** : Make sure to run the timer program not at a whole of 10 such as 7AM or 7:10 or 7:20  
				This program runs every 10 minutes so it could interfere with the automated program. 
				Please run this on something like xx:04,xx:05,xx:06,xx:07
				
* This is simply something to keep your webpage from timing out. 
* It will automatically refresh your page
* The program will refresh the page and select the pin box element so you should be able to type. But I would still suggest before 7AM clicking on the pin box so that there aren't any messups.
